     * The offset is roughly an angle with respect to the closest boundary point,
     * corrected by the margin and using some approximation far from the Field Of View.
     * It is positive if the target is outside of the Field Of view, negative inside,
     * and zero if the point is exactly on the boundary (always taking the margin
     * into account).

     * <p>
     * As Field Of View can have complex shapes that may require long computation,
     * when the target point can be proven to be outside of the Field Of View, a
     * faster but approximate computation is done, that underestimate the offset.
     * This approximation is only performed about 0.01 radians outside of the zone
     * and is designed to still return a positive value if the full accurate computation
     * would return a positive value. When target point is close to the zone (and
     * furthermore when it is inside the zone), the full accurate computation is
     * performed. This setup allows this offset to be used as a reliable way to
     * detect Field Of View boundary crossings, which correspond to sign changes of
     * the offset.
