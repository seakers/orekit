# Input file for VisibilityCircle

# The input file syntax is a set of key=value lines. Blank lines and lines
# starting with '#' (after whitespace trimming) are silently ignored. The
# equal sign may be surrounded by space characters. Keys must correspond to
# the ParameterKey enumerate constants, given that matching is not
# case sensitive and that '_' characters may appear as '.' characters in the
# file.
